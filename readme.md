CHIPS COLLECTOR GAME

The way the game works is that you need to find the 8 different items using your flashlight. When you have found them all u need to press them in order for them to get collected, after that you have won! Watch out for the imposter Pringles can, if you press it you lose the game. You could also press the restart button to play again.

2. Click on the items to collect them.
3. Dont press on the pringles can, that's game over.
4. Click the "Restart" button to reset the game and start collecting items again.
